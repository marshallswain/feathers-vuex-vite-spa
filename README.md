## Setting up Auth0 Authentication

To get up and running quickly, this template comes with Auth0 SPA login support. Auth0's free account generously provides up to 7000 active users per month.  This app template takes care of the client side of auth.  Take a look at https://github.com/morphatic/feathers-auth0-strategy for turnkey Auth0 authentication on the Feathers API server.

### Setting Up Auth

The below steps are required to get it to work. To disable it, see the next section.

1. Go to https://manage.auth0.com and create an Auth0 app.  Set the **Application Type** to `Single Page Application`.  Make note of the domain and client secret.  Add `http://localhost:3000` (or the host assigned by Vite upon startup) to the following places in the Auth0 application admin page.  (If these settings are not correct, you will see 403 errors upon loading the page.)
  - Allowed Callback URLs
  - Allowed Logout URLs
  - Allowed Web Origins
2. Rename the environment variables in to match your environment.  Also update the following files if you change the variable names:
  - `src/auth0.ts` Use the domain and client secret from step 1.
  - `src/feathers.ts` Update the `apiUrl` variable.

If you are using VS Code, you may need to use the "Reload Window" command after you configure environment variables.

### Disable Auth0

You can disable Auth0 integration by doing the following:

1. Update lines from `src/main.ts`

```js
// Remove this line
import { setupAuth0, storage } from '~/modules/auth0'

// Remove this line
setupAuth0()

// Update this line to remove the `storage` variable
const feathers = setupFeathers({ storage })
// The above line should look like this:
const feathers = setupFeathers({})
```

2. In `src/store/store.ts`, Switch back to the vanilla FeathersVuex auth plugin:

```js
// Remove this line
auth({ feathers }),

// Uncomment this line to use the default auth plugin
feathers.apiVuex.makeAuthPlugin({ userService: 'users' })
```
